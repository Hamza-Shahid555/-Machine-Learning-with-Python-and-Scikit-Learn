📈 Linear Regression 
🧠 Overview

This project demonstrates the implementation of Linear Regression, one of the most fundamental and widely used machine learning algorithms. It is used to model the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables.

🎯 Objective

The goal of this project is to:

Understand the concept of linear regression

Implement it using Python

Train a model on a dataset

Evaluate its performance

Make predictions

📊 What is Linear Regression?

Linear Regression is a supervised learning algorithm used for predicting continuous values.

🔹 Simple Idea:

It tries to fit a straight line through the data points:

𝑦
=
𝑚
𝑥
+
𝑏
y=mx+b

y → predicted output

x → input feature

m → slope (how much y changes with x)

b → intercept (starting point)
